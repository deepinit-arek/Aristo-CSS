Aristo CSS
========

An ongoing project to create the open-source [Aristo theme](http://github.com/280north/aristo) purely in CSS. No images, no extra markup.

You can see Aristo CSS in action at [aristocss.com](http://aristocss.com).

### Why did you make this?

I wanted this to exist, but no one had made it yet. I also wanted a fun CSS3 exercise.

### What did you care about while making it?

I set some important design constraints, and I've been accepting no compromises:

* **Clean, semantic HTML.** These widgets should use standard HTML markup, and require no extra wrappers or extra elements.
* **No images.** Only CSS.
* **Perfect user experience.** Widgets should behave _exactly_ as they ought to do.
* **Stupid simple deployment, with one file.** Using the theme should be as easy as including a single CSS file.
* **No extra classes or changes to markup,** so Aristo CSS uses generic element selectors.
* **Follow the original Aristo docs**, but add **special touches where appropriate**.
* **Sized in ems**, so the widgets are typographically-appropriate, easily-resized, and adaptible to many situations.

These kind of simple rules are what guide my front-end work in general, but I typically leave a little wiggle room for practicality. For Aristo CSS, I decided I would jump through whatever hoops necessary to stick to these rules strictly.

### Can I use this?

Aristo CSS is **MIT-licensed**, so please do!

If you use it, why not let me know? For example, you could tweet a link to me [@ryanmiglavs](http://twitter.com/ryanmiglavs). You could even follow me if you like this sort of thing.
